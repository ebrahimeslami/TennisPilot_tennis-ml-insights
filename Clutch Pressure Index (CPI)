| **Goal**         | Measure how well a player performs in high-pressure situations (tiebreaks, deciding sets, and break points).                |
| **Core Data**    | Match-level stats: `score`, `round`, `tourney_level`, `winner_rank`, `loser_rank`, `best_of`, and basic serve/return stats. |
| **ML Support**   | PyTorch model to normalize CPI across opponents, surfaces, and tournament levels.                                           |
| **Output Files** | `D:\Tennis\data\indices\clutch_pressure_index_match.csv` and `clutch_pressure_index_player.csv`                             |
